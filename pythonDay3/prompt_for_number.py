#prompt the user for a number then multiplies that number
# by itself. this is a comment btw

#create a variable that holds the input the user gives
user_input = int(input("Please enter a number: "))

#multiply the users input by itself
result = str(user_input *  user_input)

#show the result to the user
print(result + " is your number squared!")
